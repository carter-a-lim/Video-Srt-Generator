# Auto-Caption Generator

A user-friendly desktop application to automatically generate and format `.srt` subtitle files from any video. Built with Python and faster-whisper.


## Version 2.0.0 - The Professional Flow Update! üéâ

This is a major upgrade that introduces several advanced features for creating more natural, professional-grade captions.

**New Features:**
- ‚ú® **Advanced NLP Analysis:** A new option to use grammatical analysis (`spaCy`) for the most intelligent and natural line breaks possible.
- üß† **Orphan Word Prevention:** The formatting logic now avoids leaving single, short words on a line, improving readability.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Minimum Display Time:** Captions are now guaranteed to be on-screen long enough to be read, preventing jarring "flashes" of text.
- ‚èØÔ∏è **Pause-Sensitive Captions:** A new option to disable "always-on" captions, which respects long, dramatic pauses in speech.
- üêõ **Bug Fixes:** General improvements to the formatting engine.


**Note:** You still need to have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed on your system for the application to work.
